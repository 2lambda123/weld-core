      Weld is the reference implementation of CDI, and is used by WildFly, GlassFish and WebLogic to provide CDI services for
      Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications. Weld also goes beyond the environments and APIs defined by the
      CDI specification by providing support for a number of other environments (such as a servlet container such as
      Tomcat, or Java SE).

      experiment with one of the examples, take a look at <xref linkend="gettingstarted"/>. Otherwise read on for a
      exhaustive discussion of using Weld in all the environments and application servers it supports and the Weld
      extensions.
