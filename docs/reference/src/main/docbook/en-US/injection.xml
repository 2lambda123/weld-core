   <title>Dependency injection and programmatic lookup</title>

   <para>
      One of the most significant features of CDI &mdash; certainly the most recognized &mdash; is 
      <emphasis>typesafe</emphasis> dependency injection.

      <title>Injection points</title>

      <para>
         The <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation lets us define an injection point that is injected during bean 
         instantiation. Injection can occur through three different mechanisms.

                  A bean can have multiple initializer methods. If the bean is a session bean, the initializer method 
                  is not required to be a business method of the session bean.

      <para>
         Dependency injection always occurs when the bean instance is first instantiated by the container.
         Simplifying just a little, things happen in this order:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               First, the container calls the bean constructor (the default constructor or the one annotated
               <literal>@Inject</literal>), to obtain an instance of the bean.
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               Next, the container initializes the values of all injected fields of the bean.

         <listitem>
            <para>
               Next, the container calls all initializer methods of the bean.

            <important>
               <para>
                  This call order is not portable. Do not rely on a specific order.

         <listitem>
            <para>
               Finally, the <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> method, if any, is called.

         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>
         Note that the container may call initializer methods declared by a superclass before initializing
         injected fields declared by a subclass.
      </para>

      <note>
         <para>
            One major advantage of constructor injection is that it allows the bean to be immutable.

         <!-- TODO: Why is this an advantage? -->
      </note>
      
      <para>
         CDI also supports parameter injection for some other methods that are invoked by the container. For instance, 
         parameter injection is supported for producer methods:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Produces Checkout createCheckout(ShoppingCart cart) {
    return new Checkout(cart);
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        In this case, the <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation <emphasis>is not</emphasis> required at the
        injection point. The same is true for observer methods (which we'll meet in <xref linkend="events"/>) and
        disposer methods. <!-- TODO: Where are disposer methods? -->
      </para>
   </section>

   <section>
      <title>What gets injected</title>

      <para>
         The CDI specification defines a <emphasis>typesafe resolution</emphasis> procedure that the container 
         follows when identifying the bean to inject to an injection point. Typesafe resolution is performed at system
         initialization time, which means that the container will inform the developer immediately if a bean's
         dependencies cannot be satisfied.
      </para>

      <para>
         The purpose of this algorithm is to allow multiple beans to implement the same bean type and either:
      </para>

         <listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Obviously, if you have exactly one bean of a given type, and an injection point with that same type, then bean
         A is going to go into slot A. This is the simplest possible scenario. Your first applications will likely
         have lots of these.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         But then, things start to get complicated. Let's explore how the container determines which bean to inject in
         more advanced cases. We'll start by taking a closer look at qualifiers.
      </para>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Qualifier annotations</title>

      <para>
         If we have more than one bean that implements a particular bean type, the injection point can specify exactly
         which bean should be injected using a qualifier annotation. For example, there might be two implementations of
         <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal>:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Synchronous
public class SynchronousPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
   public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>      

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Asynchronous
public class AsynchronousPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
   public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Here, <literal>@Synchronous</literal> and <literal>@Asynchronous</literal> are qualifier annotations, 
         defined like so:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
public @interface Synchronous {}]]></programlisting>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
public @interface Asynchronous {}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         A client bean developer uses the qualifier annotation to specify exactly which bean should be injected. 
         This can be done with field injection, initializer method injection, or constructor injection.
      </para>

      <para>Using field injection:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Synchronous PaymentProcessor syncPaymentProcessor;
@Inject @Asynchronous PaymentProcessor asyncPaymentProcessor;]]></programlisting>

      <para>Using initializer method injection:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject
public void setPaymentProcessors(@Synchronous PaymentProcessor syncPaymentProcessor, 
                                 @Asynchronous PaymentProcessor asyncPaymentProcessor) {
   this.syncPaymentProcessor = syncPaymentProcessor;
   this.asyncPaymentProcessor = asyncPaymentProcessor;
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>Using constructor injection:</para>

     <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject
public Checkout(@Synchronous PaymentProcessor syncPaymentProcessor, 
                @Asynchronous PaymentProcessor asyncPaymentProcessor) {
   this.syncPaymentProcessor = syncPaymentProcessor;
   this.asyncPaymentProcessor = asyncPaymentProcessor;
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Qualifier annotations can also qualify method arguments of producer, disposer and observer methods. Combining
         qualified arguments with producer methods is a good way to select an implementation of a bean type at runtime,
         based on system state:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Produces
PaymentProcessor getPaymentProcessor(@Synchronous PaymentProcessor syncPaymentProcessor,
                                     @Asynchronous PaymentProcessor asyncPaymentProcessor) {
   return isSynchronous() ? syncPaymentProcessor : asyncPaymentProcessor;
}]]></programlisting> 
   
      <para>
         If an injected field or a parameter of a bean constructor or initializer method is not explicitly annotated 
         with a qualifier, the default qualifier, <literal>@Default</literal>, is assumed.
      </para><!-- Is it necessary to state this when this is covered in the following section? -->

      <para>
         Using qualifiers differs from specifying an implementation class in that qualifiers do not create a direct
         dependency to any particular implementation. A qualifier is like an extension of the interface; there
         can be multiple alternative implementations of <literal>@Asynchronous PaymentProcessor</literal>.
      </para>

   </section>
   
   <section>
      <title>The built-in qualifiers <literal>@Default</literal> and <literal>@Any</literal></title>
      
      <para>Whenever a bean or injection point does not explicitly declare a qualifier, the container assumes the
      qualifier <literal>@Default</literal>. From time to time, you'll need to decare an injection point without
      specifying a qualifier. There's a qualifier for that too. All beans have the qualifier <literal>@Any</literal>.
      By explicitly specifying <literal>@Any</literal> at an injection point, you suppress the default
      qualifier, without otherwise restricting the beans that are eligible for injection.</para>
      
      <para>
         This is especially useful if you want to iterate over all beans with a certain bean type, for example:
      </para>
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject 
void initServices(@Any Instance<Service> services) { 
   for (Service service: services) {
      service.init();
   }
}]]></programlisting>
      
   </section>

      <section>
         <title>Qualifiers with members</title>

         <para>
            Java annotations can have members. Annotation members can be used to further discriminate a qualifier. This 
            prevents a potential explosion of new annotations. For example, instead of creating several qualifiers 
            representing different payment methods, we could aggregate them into a single annotation with a member:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER, TYPE})
public @interface PayBy {
   PaymentMethod value();
}]]></programlisting> 
   
         <para>
            Then we select one of the possible member values when appling the qualifier:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[private @Inject @PayBy(CHECK) PaymentProcessor checkPayment;]]></programlisting> 

         <para>
            We can force the container to ignore a member of a qualifier type by annotating the member 
            <literal>@Nonbinding</literal>.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER, TYPE})
public @interface PayBy {
   PaymentMethod value();
   @Nonbinding String comment() default "";
}]]></programlisting> 

      </section>

      <section>
         <title>Multiple qualifiers</title>

         <para>
            An injection point may specify multiple qualifiers:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Synchronous @Reliable PaymentProcessor syncPaymentProcessor;]]></programlisting>

         <para>
            Then only a bean which has <emphasis>both</emphasis> qualifier annotations would be eligible for
            injection.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Synchronous @Reliable
public class SynchronousReliablePaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
   public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>

      </section>
   
   <section id="alternatives">
      <title>Alternatives</title>
      
      <para>
         Alternatives are beans whose implementation is specific to a particular client module or deployment
         scenario. The following alternative defines a mock implementation of both 
         <literal>@Synchronous PaymentProcessor</literal> and <literal>@Asynchronous PaymentProcessor</literal>, 
         all in one:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Alternative @Synchronous @Asynchronous
public class MockPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
   public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>
      
      <para>
         By default, <literal>@Alternative</literal> beans are disabled. We need to <emphasis>enable</emphasis> an
         alternative in the <literal>beans.xml</literal> descriptor of a bean archive to make it available for
         instantiation and injection. This activation only applies to the beans in that archive.
      </para>

      <para>
         When an ambiguous dependency exists at an injection point, the container attempts to resolve the ambiguity
         by looking for an enabled alternative among the beans that could be injected. If there is exactly one
         enabled alternative, then that alternative bean will be injected.

      <title>Fixing unsatisfied and ambiguous dependencies</title>
  
      <para>
         The typesafe resolution algorithm fails when, after considering the qualifier annotations on all beans that
         implement the bean type of an injection point and filtering out disabled beans (<literal>@Alternative</literal>
         beans which are not explicitly enabled), the container is unable to identify exactly one bean to inject. The
         container will abort deployment, informing us of the unsatisfied or ambiguous dependency.

      </para>
  
      <para>
         Now there's one more issue you need to be aware of when using the dependency injection service.
      </para>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Client proxies</title>
  
      <para>
         Clients of an injected bean do not usually hold a direct reference to a bean instance, unless the bean is
         a dependent object (scoped with the <literal>@Dependent</literal> annotation).
      </para> 
  
      <para>
         Imagine that a bean bound to the application scope holds a direct reference to a bean bound to the request
         scope. The application-scoped bean is shared between many different requests. However, each request should see
         a different instance of the request scoped bean &mdash; the current one!
      </para>
  
      <para>
         Now imagine that a bean bound to the session scope holds a direct reference to a bean bound to the application
         scope. From time to time, the session context is serialized to disk in order to use memory more efficiently.
         However, the application scoped bean instance should not be serialized along with the session scoped bean. The
         application can retrieve the reference at any time, so there is no need to store it.
      </para>
  
      <para>
         Therefore, unless a bean has the default scope <literal>@Dependent</literal>, the container must direct all
         injected references to the bean through a proxy object. This <emphasis>client proxy</emphasis> ensures that
         the bean instance that receives a method invocation is the instance that is associated with the current
         context. The client proxy also allows beans bound to contexts such as the session context to be serialized to
         disk without recursively serializing other injected beans.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Unfortunately, due to limitations of the Java language, some Java types cannot be proxied by the container. 
         If an injection point declared with one of these types resolves to a bean with any scope other than 
         <literal>@Dependent</literal>, the container will abort deployment, informing us of the problem.
      </para>
  
      <para>The following Java types cannot be proxied by the container:</para>
  
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>classes without a non-private constructor with no parameters,</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               classes which are declared <literal>final</literal> or have a <literal>final</literal> method, and

         You might come across an unproxyable dependency problem. These are easily fixed.

      <title>Obtaining a contextual instance by programmatic lookup</title>

      <para>
         In certain situations, injection is not the best way to obtain a contextual reference. For example,
         it can't be used when:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               the bean type or qualifiers vary dynamically at runtime,
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               there is no bean which satisfies the type and qualifiers, or
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               we would like to iterate over all beans of a certain type.
            </para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         In these situations, the application can obtain an instance of the <literal>Instance</literal> interface, 
         parameterized for the bean type, by injection:
      </para>
  
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject Instance<PaymentProcessor> paymentProcessorSource;]]></programlisting>
  
      <para>
         The <literal>get()</literal> method of <literal>Instance</literal> produces a contextual instance of the bean.
      </para>
  
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[PaymentProcessor p = paymentProcessorSource.get();]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Qualifiers can be specified in one of two ways:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>by annotating the <literal>Instance</literal> injection point, or</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>by passing qualifiers to the <literal>select()</literal> of <literal>Event</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Specifying the qualifiers at the injection point is simpler:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Asynchronous Instance<PaymentProcessor> paymentProcessorSource;]]></programlisting>
      
      <para>
         Now, the <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> returned by <literal>get()</literal> will have the qualifier
         <literal>@Asynchronous</literal>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Alternatively, we can specify the qualifier dynamically. First, we add the <literal>@Any</literal> qualifier to
         the injection point, to suppress the default qualifier. (All beans have the qualifier <literal>@Any</literal>.)
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Any Instance<PaymentProcessor> paymentProcessorSource;]]></programlisting>
      
      <para>
         Next, we need to obtain an instance of our qualifier type. Since annotatons are interfaces,
         <literal>new Asynchronous()</literal> is incorrect. Creating a concrete implementation of an annotation type
         from scratch is tedious. CDI lets us obtain a qualifier instance by giving the helper class 
         <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal> a subclass:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[abstract class AsynchronousQualifier
extends AnnotationLiteral<Asynchronous> implements Asynchronous {}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         In some cases, we can use an anonymous class:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[PaymentProcessor p = paymentProcessorSource
   .select(new AnnotationLiteral<Asynchronous>() {});]]></programlisting>
   
      <para>
         However, we can't use an anonymous class to implement a qualifier type with members.
      </para>
               
      <para>
         Now, finally, we can pass the qualifier to the <literal>select()</literal> method of 
         <literal>Instance</literal>.
      </para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[Annotation qualifier = synchronously ?
      new SynchronousQualifier() : new AsynchronousQualifier();
PaymentProcessor p = anyPaymentProcessor.select(qualifier).get().process(payment);]]></programlisting> 

   </section>

<section>
  <title>The <literal>InjectionPoint</literal> object</title>
  
  <para>There are certain kinds of dependent objects (beans with the <literal>@Dependent</literal> scope) 
  that need to know something about the object or injection point into which they are injected, in order 
  to perform their function. Some such objects are:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>the log category for a <literal>Logger</literal>, which depends upon the class of the object 
      that owns it;</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>an injected HTTP parameter or header value, which depends on the parameter or header name specified 
      at the injection point; and</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>an injected EL expression evaluation result, which depends on the expression specified at the 
         injection point.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>A dependent bean can inject an instance of <literal>InjectionPoint</literal> and access metadata 
      relating to the injection point to which it belongs.</para>

  <para>Let's look at an example. The following code is verbose, and vulnerable to refactoring problems:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Logger log = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());]]></programlisting>

  <para>However, the following producer method lets you inject a JDK <literal>Logger</literal> without 
  explicitly specifying the log category:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[class LogFactory {

   @Produces Logger createLogger(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) { 
      return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName()); 
   }

}]]></programlisting>

  <para>This lets us write the following, instead of the initial verbose code:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject Logger log;]]></programlisting>

  <para>As a second example, to inject HTTP parameters, we need to define a qualifier type:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@BindingType
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
public @interface HttpParam {
   @Nonbinding public String value();
}]]></programlisting>

  <para>We would use this qualifier type at injection points as follows:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@HttpParam("username") String username;
@HttpParam("password") String password;]]></programlisting>

  <para>The following producer method does the work:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[class HttpParams

   @Produces @HttpParam("")
   String getParamValue(InjectionPoint ip) {
      ServletRequest request = (ServletRequest) FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequest();
      return request.getParameter(ip.getAnnotated().getAnnotation(HttpParam.class).value());
   }

}]]></programlisting>

  <para>Note that request acquisition in this example is specific to JSF. For a more generic solution,
  you could write your own producer for the request and inject it as a method parameter.</para>

  <para>Note also that the <literal>value()</literal> member of the <literal>HttpParam</literal>
  annotation is ignored by the container, since it is annotated <literal>@Nonbinding.</literal></para>

  <para>The container provides a built-in bean that implements the <literal>InjectionPoint</literal> 
  interface:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface InjectionPoint { 
   public Type getType();
   public Set<Annotation> getQualifiers();
   public Bean<?> getBean();
   public Member getMember();
   public Annotated getAnnotated();
   public boolean isDelegate();
   public boolean isTransient();
}]]></programlisting>
