= Notes on Jakarta EE 9 javax to jakarta namespace changes

These are notes on the changes that have been made in pepartation for migrating the
packages from javax to jakarta as needed for the Jakarta EE 9 release.

== Status as of Dec 13 2019
An initial update was done just to allow the dependency-injection TCK to be run against
Weld so that an initial candidate release of that dependency can be done.

The following Jakarta EE 9 dependencies needed to be downloaded and snapshots built locally:
* https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/injection-api
  * version is 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
* https://github.com/scottmarlow/interceptor-api.git api subproject from Scott Marlow's jaka fork of jakarta.interceptor-api that contains a PR to update the javax packages. It is in the switch2JakartaNamespace branch.
  * version is 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
* https://github.com/starksm64/api Scott Stark fork of https://github.com/weld/api to update the
javax.enterprise package to jakarta.enterprise
  * version is 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT
* https://github.com/starksm64/jboss-el-api_spec/tree/jboss-el-api_4.0-1.0.x for jarkarta-el. This is a fork of the existing jboss-el-api_spec fork by Scott Stark that updates the packages in a jboss-el-api_4.0-1.0.x branch. A PR is https://github.com/jboss/jboss-el-api_spec/pull/26
  * version is 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
* https://github.com/starksm64/arquillian-container-weld/tree/jakartaee9 Scott Stark fork of arquillian-container-weld to
update the javax package to jakarta.
  * version is 3.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT

=== TODOs:

* The dependency on the https://github.com/weld/api project needs to be replaced with https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cdi
* The arquillian weld container build has many test failures:
